    <h2>How to upload readings</h2>
    <p>Content in EPUB, Word, or PDF formats can be uploaded directly to Clusive.</p>

    <h3>✓ EPUB</h3>
    <p>EPUB is a common format for electronic books. You can find EPUBs at
        <a href="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard eBooks</a>,
        <a href="https://tarheelreader.org/">Tar Heel Reader</a>, or other sites.
        You can also create EPUBs from Word documents with the free
        <a href="https://daisy.org/activities/software/wordtoepub/">DAISY WordToEpub Converter</a>
        (Windows only), or from open resources using
        <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/authoring-overview">OER Commons</a> OpenAuthor.</p>

    <h3>✓ Microsoft Word</h3>
    <p>Make sure it is saved in the latest Word format (.docx).</p>

    <p>If you have a <strong>Google Doc</strong>, use the <em>File - Download - Microsoft Word</em> menu item
        to get a .docx file to upload.</p>

    <h3><span class="icon-warning"/> PDF</h3>
    <p>You can upload a PDF file directly. Note, however, that many of Clusive's adaptive features are not supported
    in PDF readings. For full access to all Clusive has to offer, consider converting your PDF into an EPUB or
    Word document. Just 5 minutes of effort can make a huge difference in the reading experience!</p>
    <p>If you have the desktop version of Microsoft Word, open your PDF with it for a one-step conversion
        to a flexible format.</p>

    <h2>Add from Bookshare</h2>
    <p>If you have a Bookshare account, you can search for and add Bookshare books right here in Clusive.
    {% if request.clusive_user.can_upload %}
    Go to <a href="{% url 'my_account' %}">My Account</a> and click <strong>Connect to a Bookshare account</strong>
    to get started.</p>
    {% endif %}
