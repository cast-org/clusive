      <p>Navy Lieutenant Nunn arrived this morning at Lord Dartmouth's with
        letters from General Gage, Lord Percy, and Lieutenant-Colonel Smith
        concerning the events that occurred on April 19th and involved the British
        troops, the colonial militia, and several rebel parties.
        Lieutenant-Colonel Smith was concerned about the chaos that was occurring
        north of Boston and sent six light infantry companies to secure two
        bridges near Concord. On their way to complete this order, <!--hint ref="3"-->the
        companies found a group of armed country people near the road in
        Lexington.<!--/hint--> As the British troops approached them to find out
        why they had assembled, the members of this militia ran off in great
        confusion. <!--hint ref="1"-->During this time, several shots were fired
        at the British troops from behind a stone wall, a meeting house, and other
        homes. One British solider was wounded, and Major Pitcairn's horse was
        shot in two places.<!--/hint--> As a response to the rebels' attack, the
        British troops fired and killed several of them. Then, the troops
        continued marching to Concord unharmed.</p>

    <h2>Deposition</h2>

    <p>The legal document below is the testimony of one of the colonists at
    the Battle of Lexington which happened on April 19, 1775 in Lexington,
    Massachusetts. The testimony was recorded seven days after the battle. How
    does Captain Parker want you to feel about the American colonists? How
    does he want you to feel about the British soldiers? What word choices
    does Captain Parker use to encourage you to form an opinion about each
    group? <!----></p>

    <div class="parchment-0">
      <p>I ordered our militia to meet on the common in Lexington to decide what
      to do about the approaching British army. We decided not to let them find
      us assembled there or to fight them unless they attacked us. <!--hint ref="2"--><!--hint ref="3"-->As
      the British army marched closer to us, I told our militia to leave and not
      to fire their weapons.<!--/hint--><!--/hint--> <!--hint ref="1"-->Suddenly,
      the British army arrived and immediately charged us, fired their weapons,
      and killed eight of our citizens.<!--/hint--> <!--hint ref="3"-->We did

    <h2>Diary Entry</h2>

    <p>The diary entry here was written by a British army soldier the same day
    as the Battle of Lexington, April 19, 1775. As you read through this
    document, think about how Lieutenant Barker describes the events leading
    up to the battle. What does Lieutenant Barker say happened? What words and
    details help you understand how the British soldiers were feeling,
    thinking, and acting? Does the fact that this is a diary entry make it
    more, or less, convincing to you? <!----></p>

    <div class="parchment-0">
      <p>April 19th At 2 o'clock in the morning we marched across a river with
      water up to our waists. After marching a few more miles, we captured three
      or four people who were trying to warn the colonial militias that we were
      marching toward Concord. <!--hint ref="3"-->Later, when we were about five
      miles from Lexington, we were notified that a few hundred townspeople had
      gathered together to prevent us from moving forward. <!--hint ref="4"-->At
      5 o'clock we arrived at Lexington and saw between 200 and 300 people
      gathered in the middle of town.<!--/hint--> Though we knew that they might
      attach us,<!--/hint--> we marched forward without any intent to harm them.
      <!--hint ref="2"--><!--hint ref="1"-->As we got closer, they fired one or
      two shots at us.<!--/hint--> Then, without any orders to do so, our troops
      charged them, firing several shots.<!--/hint--> Several people from their
      militia were killed, but I am not sure how many because they were hidden
      behind walls and in the woods. Only one of our men from the 10th light
      infantry was wounded. Our troops were so wild that they could not hear our
      orders, and it was difficult to get them to reassemble at the common.
      After we did finally get them together, we waited there for some time
      there and then proceeded to Concord. </p>

    <h2>Etching</h2>

    <p>This drawing was created shortly after the Battle of Lexington, which
    happened on April 19, 1775, and was widely distributed throughout the
    American colonies. As you look at the image, think about how the artist’s
    choices show his opinion about what happened. What details might reveal
    the artist’s opinion about who was to blame for the battle? How are the
    British soldiers portrayed? How are the American colonists drawn? <!----></p>

    <h2>Report</h2>

    <p>This document is a report sent by a leader of the British troops at the
    Battle of Lexington to his commanding officer. The battle happened on
    April 19, 1775 and this report was sent seven days after the battle. As
    you read the report, look for how Major Pitcairn wants his commanding
    officer to view Pitcairn’s actions, the British soldiers, and the American
    colonists. What details show you how he wants the General to think about
    each of these? <!----></p>

      <p>Sir,</p>

      <p>Since you are anxious to know what happened at Lexington on the 19th, I
      will be as clear as possible to state the facts.</p>

      <p><!--hint ref="2"-->As we marched toward Lexington, I told our troops
      not to even think about firing their weapons without my orders.<!--/hint-->
      <!--hint ref="4"-->When we arrived there, I saw about 200 rebels gathered
      at the green.<!--/hint--> As our troops got within 100 yards of them, they
      ran off behind a stone wall to our right. As our troops began running
      after them, <!--hint ref="2"-->I shouted that they were not to fire their
      weapons-that they should only surround and disarm the rebels<!--/hint-->.
      I repeated this order several times. <!--hint ref="1"--><!--hint ref="3"-->Then,
      some of the rebels who had hidden behind the wall shot four or five times
      at our troops, wounding one of our soldiers in the 10th light infantry. My
      horse was also wounded in two places. The rebels also began firing from a
      meeting house.<!--/hint--><!--/hint--> Without any orders to do so, our
      troops began firing at the rebels. This fighting continued for some time,
      even though the other officers and I repeatedly told our troops not to
      fire.</p>

      <p>I am, Sir, Your Most Obedient Humble Servant</p>

    <h2>Sworn Deposition</h2>

    <p>The legal document below is a summary of testimony of twenty-one
    American colonists at the Battle of Lexington, gathered by Joseph Warren,
    an American colonist. The battle itself occurred on April 19, 1775 in
    Lexington, Massachusetts and this testimony was recorded seven days after
    the battle. How does Joseph Warren feel about the troops commanded by
    General Gage? How does he feel about the inhabitants of Lexington? What
    details help you discover how Warren feels? <!----></p>

    <div> <strong>Deposed:</strong> 21 Lexington Residents<br/>
    <strong>Title:</strong> To the Inhabitants of Great Britain<br/>
    <strong>Year Created:</strong> April 26, 1775<br/> <strong>Type:</strong>
    Sworn Deposition<br/> </div>

    <div class="parchment-0">
      <p>To: The inhabitants of Great Britain</p>

      <p>From: The Provincial Congress in Watertown; April 26, 1775 </p>

      <p>It is very important that you have a true and authentic account of what
      happened in Lexington on April 19th. </p>

      <p>The 21 testimonies we collected are from those who witnessed this
      inhumane event. It appears that they agree about the following: On the
      night before the 19th, our militia gathered at the common. They had been
      notified that the British army would be marching through our town on its
      way to Concord. <!--hint ref="3"-->When the army arrived, our militia
      began to peacefully disperse.<!--/hint--> <!--hint ref="1"-->The army,
      however, began to rush our militia and fire at them. They killed eight of
      our citizens and wounded several others.<!--/hint--> The army continued
      its attach until everyone from our militia, who was not dead or wounded,
      had escaped.</p>

      <p>Despite this horrible act of violence against us, we remain your
      brothers and will continue to be loyal subjects to our king. But we will
      not submit to the tyranny of his cruel ministry. With Heaven on our side,
      we shall die or be free.</p>

      <p>Joseph Warren</p>
