				<p>In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp, and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before; for now the shadow of a real trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort; and, as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully, and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them. Everything seemed very strange when they went down⁠—so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within. Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah’s familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on. The big trunk stood ready in the hall, mother’s cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa, and mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution. Meg’s eyes kept filling in spite of herself; Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once; and the little girls’ wore a grave, troubled expression, as if sorrow was a new experience to them.</p>
				<p>Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near, and they sat waiting for the carriage, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> March said to the girls, who were all busied about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up her travelling bag⁠—</p>
				<p>“Children, I leave you to Hannah’s care and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Laurence’s protection. Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own. I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly. Don’t grieve and fret when I am gone, or think that you can comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget. Go on with your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace. Hope and keep busy; and whatever happens, remember that you never can be fatherless.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, mother.”</p>
				<p>“Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and, in any perplexity, go to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Laurence. Be patient, Jo, don’t get despondent or do rash things; write to me often, and be my brave girl, ready to help and cheer us all. Beth, comfort yourself with your music, and be faithful to the little home duties; and you, Amy, help all you can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home.”</p>
				<p>“We will, mother! we will!”</p>
				<p>The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen. That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well: no one cried, no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to father, remembering, as they spoke, that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away.</p>
				<p>Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him “<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Greatheart” on the spot.</p>
				<p>“Goodbye, my darlings! God bless and keep us all!” whispered <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> March, as she kissed one dear little face after the other, and hurried into the carriage.</p>
				<p>As she rolled away, the sun came out, and, looking back, she saw it shining on the group at the gate, like a good omen. They saw it also, and smiled and waved their hands; and the last thing she beheld, as she turned the corner, was the four bright faces, and behind them, like a bodyguard, old <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.</p>
				<p>“How kind everyone is to us!” she said, turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young man’s face.</p>
				<p>“I don’t see how they can help it,” returned <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Brooke, laughing so infectiously that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> March could not help smiling; and so the long journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and cheerful words.</p>
				<p>“I feel as if there had been an earthquake,” said Jo, as their neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh themselves.</p>
				<p>“It seems as if half the house was gone,” added Meg forlornly.</p>
				<p>Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to the pile of nicely-mended hose which lay on mother’s table, showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them. It was a little thing, but it went straight to their hearts; and, in spite of their brave resolutions, they all broke down, and cried bitterly.</p>
				<p>Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and, when the shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue, armed with a coffeepot.</p>
				<p>“Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don’t fret. Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let’s fall to work, and be a credit to the family.”</p>
				<p>Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that morning. No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffeepot. They drew up to the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten minutes were all right again.</p>
				<p>“ ‘Hope and keep busy;’ that’s the motto for us, so let’s see who will remember it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won’t she lecture though!” said Jo, as she sipped with returning spirit.</p>
				<p>“I shall go to my Kings, though I’d much rather stay at home and attend to things here,” said Meg, wishing she hadn’t made her eyes so red.</p>
				<p>“No need of that; Beth and I can keep house perfectly well,” put in Amy, with an important air.</p>
				<p>“Hannah will tell us what to do; and we’ll have everything nice when you come home,” added Beth, getting out her mop and dish-tub without delay.</p>
				<p>“I think anxiety is very interesting,” observed Amy, eating sugar, pensively.</p>
				<p>The girls couldn’t help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar-bowl.</p>
				<p>The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again; and when the two went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother’s face. It was gone; but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she was, nodding away at them like a rosy-faced mandarin.</p>
				<p>“That’s so like my Beth!” said Jo, waving her hat, with a grateful face. “Goodbye, Meggy; I hope the Kings won’t train today. Don’t fret about father, dear,” she added, as they parted.</p>
				<p>“And I hope Aunt March won’t croak. Your hair <em>is</em> becoming, and it looks very boyish and nice,” returned Meg, trying not to smile at the curly head, which looked comically small on her tall sister’s shoulders.</p>
				<p>“That’s my only comfort;” and, touching her hat à la Laurie, away went Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.</p>
				<p>News from their father comforted the girls very much; for, though dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had already done him good. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and, as the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the despatches, which grew more and more cheering as the week passed. At first, everyone was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter-box by one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their Washington correspondence. As one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and read them:⁠—</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
					<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">“My Dearest Mother⁠—</p>
					<p>“It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us, for the news was so good we couldn’t help laughing and crying over it. How very kind <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Brooke is, and how fortunate that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Laurence’s business detains him near you so long, since he is so useful to you and father. The girls are all as good as gold. Jo helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs. I should be afraid she might overdo, if I didn’t know that her ‘moral fit’ wouldn’t last long. Beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what you told her. She grieves about father, and looks sober except when she is at her little piano. Amy minds me nicely, and I take great care of her. She does her own hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings. She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen, as Jo says; and Laurie is very kind and neighborly. He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah is a perfect saint; she does not scold at all, and always calls me Miss ‘Margaret,’ which is quite proper, you know, and treats me with respect. We are all well and busy; but we long, day and night, to have you back. Give my dearest love to father, and believe me, ever your own</p>
					<p class="signature">“Meg.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper, ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed letters:⁠—</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
					<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">“My Precious Marmee⁠—</p>
					<p>“Three cheers for dear father! Brooke was a trump to telegraph right off, and let us know the minute he was better. I rushed up garret when the letter came, and tried to thank God for being so good to us; but I could only cry, and say, ‘I’m glad! I’m glad!’ Didn’t that do as well as a regular prayer? for I felt a great many in my heart. We have such funny times; and now I can enjoy them, for everyone is so desperately good, it’s like living in a nest of turtledoves. You’d laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish. She gets prettier every day, and I’m in love with her sometimes. The children are regular archangels, and I⁠—well, I’m Jo, and never shall be anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn’t speak as I ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn’t come again till I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn’t, and got mad. It lasted all day; I felt bad, and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are both so proud, it’s hard to beg pardon; but I thought he’d come to it, for I <em>was</em> in the right. He didn’t come; and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river. I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun set on <em>my</em> anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I met him at the gate, coming for the same thing. We both laughed, begged each other’s pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.</p>
					<p>“I made a ‘pome’ yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash; and, as father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse him. Give him the lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself a dozen times for your</p>
